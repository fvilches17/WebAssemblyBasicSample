## Notes
This solution contains C code. The C code was compiled into .wasm and downloaded by using https://wasdk.github.io/WasmFiddle/

You can always get a Web Assembly-Supported compiler up and running on your local machine. But in order to keep this demo simple we are relying on Wasm Fiddle in order to add/modify .wasm files.
